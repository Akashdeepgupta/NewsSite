They want to take revenge on Punjab because they have so far failed to serve the interests of their capitalist comrades with the black anti-farmer laws. BJP's anti-farmer conspiracy will not succeed,\" he added.\nAt around 6 p.m. on Wednesday, former Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh reached Amit Shah's residence on Wednesday and met him for 50 minutes.\nDuring this, Amarinder Singh said that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) should be guaranteed by repealing all the three agricultural laws passed by the Modi government.\nAlong with this, the issue of farmers' agitation going on for the last 10 months should also be resolved by the Central Government at the earliest.\nHowever, it is also being said that during the meeting, political discussions have also taken place between the two leaders.\nIt is noteworthy that Singh has been in Delhi for the last two days, as soon as he reached Delhi on Tuesday, there was speculation about his meeting with\nAmit Shah.\nHowever, a statement later said he has come to Delhi on a personal tour.\nOn Tuesday, just before he reached Delhi, Punjab Congress state president Navjot Singh Sidhu had also resigned. Therefore, in this situation, this meeting is being described as \"very important\".\n--IANS\nptk/pgh\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nDear Reader,\nBusiness Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

(Retd.) Amarinder Singh exploring an arrangement with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\nMr. Singh, who was removed as the Chief Minister of Punjab by the party at the instance of the Gandhi siblings, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, met Union Home MInister Amit Shah, although no statement was available from either side.\nAlso Read\nPunjab Congress crisis | Will stick to principles and fight, says Sidhu\nFormer Union Minister Kapil Sibal, part of a group that is demanding elections and reforms in the party, told reporters at a press conference that, in our party, at the moment, there is no president and one doesnt know who is taking these decisions.\nHis colleague, Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is part of the group of 23 letter writers, the G-23, seeking internal reforms, wrote a fresh letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to convene a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) for a debate on the state of affairs in the party.\nCongress workers from Chandni Chowk, the constituency that Mr. Sibal has represented in the Lok Sabha in the past, protested outside his residence, holding placards with get well soon messages, even though there was no direct response from the party to the press conference.\nAlso Read\nStability in Punjab essential for national security, BJP slams Congress for clash of ambitions\nLate in the evening, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala sent out a cryptic tweet that those in power are troubled that a Dalit has been made a CM in Punjab and Amit Shahs residence has become a centre for anti-Dalit activities.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Sibal had questioned the decision-making process with, We know yet we dont know.\nWhile Sonia Gandhi is the acting president of the party, many believe that most decisions are being taken by her children. The Gandhi siblings had backed Navjot Singh Sidhu, who campaigned for Mr. Singhs removal but resigned as State unit president himself on Tuesday, plunging the party into a crisis.\nQuoting Mahatma Gandhi that no school of thought can claim a monopoly of right judgement, Mr. Sibal argued that no monopolies can be created in the power structures of the party, and asserted that the G-23 is certainly not ji huzoor 23, an idiomatic expression referring to a yes-man.\nThe former Law Minister also confirmed that one of his senior colleagues had written a letter to Ms. Gandhi but didnt name Mr Azad.\nSome things we cannot say in public. At least a dialogue can take place in the CWC as to why we are in this state. We are the ones who can fight the BJP, and let me assure you that we are not one of those who is going to leave the ideology of the party, Mr. Sibal said, adding, Ironically, people close to them [the Gandhis] are leaving the party.\nThe reformists or the G-23, who had written to Ms. Gandhi seeking internal party reforms in August 2020, reiterated their demand for an elected CWC, Central Election Committee, and a full-time elected president.\nIf somebody has an issue, that is to be discussed. Consultations must take place from the seniormost members of the party and the organisation structure of the party has to be strengthened...We need an open dialogue, conversations, and need to understand each others point of view, Mr. Sibal said\nThe former Minister refused to answer whether or not appointing Mr. Sidhu as the Punjab Congress Committee (PCC) chief, and removing Capt. Singh as the Chief Minister, was the right decision.\nI dont want to talk about Punjab but a border State, and if this happening to the Congress, [it] means it is [an] advantage to the ISI [Inter Services Intelligence] and Pakistan. We know the history of Punjab and the rise of extremism there and how forces across the border try to take advantage of the situation, he said.\nReacting to Mr. Sibal, Indian Youth Congress president B.V. Srinivas tweeted: Listen Ji Huzoor. The partys president and leader is the same who always sent you to Parliament, made you a minister when the p[a]rty had better days. In the Opposition, made you a member of the Rajya Sabha. Always gave you responsibility during good and bad times. Now, when the time has come for struggle, then...\nAfter Mr. Sidhus latest antics in quitting his post as PCC chief, the Gandhis have come under severe criticism as they had overruled a three-member committee, led by Mallikarjun Kharge, to appoint him.\nIn their report to Ms. Gandhi, the panel had recommended that the cricketer-turned-politician be made the chief of the Congress Campaign Committee for the next years Assembly polls and accommodated as a Minister in the Amarinder Singh government.\nSoon after Mr. Sibals outburst, Congress general secretary Ajay Maken hit back on Wednesday.\nMr. Maken said it was Ms. Sonia Gandhi who had made Mr. Sibal a Union Minister though he did not have any organisational background and experience.\nMy appeal to Mr. Sibal and others like him is that they should not denigrate the organisation which has given them political identity by rushing to the media every then and now, Mr. Maken told the PTI.\nSuch remarks by leaders like Sibal, who have got everything from the organisation and the leadership, demoralise the party cadres and ordinary workers who continue to stand with the Congress ideology and are fighting the fundamental and fascist forces on the streets, he said.\n(With Inputs from PTI)",

But U.S. health officials now recommend boosters for some people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 based on evidence that protection against milder disease can wane, especially among older adults.\nThe CDC says people 65 and older, long-term care residents and others ages 50 to 64 with health problems such as diabetes or heart disease should get boosters if they got Pfizer shots at least six months ago.\nThe agency stopped short of recommending boosters for people 18 to 49 with health problems, but says they can also get the shot after considering their individual risk. The same is true for anyone 18 to 64 whose job could put them at higher risk for infection, such as health care workers, teachers, first responders, agriculture workers and public transit workers.\nPeople who got the Moderna and J&J vaccines aren't eligible for boosters yet, but that's likely coming soon.\nThe availability of boosters varies around the world. Britain and Israel have also been giving boosters, despite objections from the World Health Organization that poor countries still don't have enough for their initial doses.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nDear Reader,\nBusiness Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

        "body": "Print\nSir,\nAfter months of suspense, the Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has been replaced with Dalit leader Charanjit Singh Channi who took his oath as the Chief Minister. Punjab being a border state affected by militancy in the eighties, anything happening in Punjab is sensitive. The change could have been smooth, but the high command in its wisdom decided to change guard just five months before the Assembly elections.\nSolving one problem in Punjab has created other problems. The echo of rebellion is also heard from two other Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. The Punjab example is likely to raise the hope of other rebels who have been demanding the ouster of their respective chief ministers for some time.\nThe Congress party faces a leadership crisis at the national level, with Sonia Gandhi acting as an interim president. Rahul Gandhi is the de facto ruler of the party, even after resigning his presidentship in 2019. Priyanka Gandhi is also emerging as a power centre, as is seen from the Punjab decision. The story of Punjab is the story of ascending power of the two Gandhis who persuaded their mother to change the Captain and replaced him with a weak leader. It is they who promoted the ambitious Sidhu who aimed to replace the Captain. The story is not over as Sidhu is still dreaming of becoming chief minister. The Congress gamble may or may not work in Punjab.\nThe moral of the story is that high command culture can be a success so long as the leadership is strong. It might have clicked with Indira Gandhi, but the present leadership comes nowhere near her political acumen. The same medicine does not work at all times.\nThe BJP, too, has changed with the party adopting the high command culture. For instance, the BJP has changed three chief ministers in Karnataka, Uttarakhand, and Gujarat in the past few months. Today Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Home Minister Amit Shah are all-powerful. The BJPs tactics are similar to the Indira Gandhi era. Ultimately it is the vote catcher who matters in any political party, which is why they succeed.\nKalyani Shankar",

The Hindu was urged not to reveal the identity of the three former MPs who were known for their fierce criticism of the Taliban.\nThe three former MPs were being assisted by Vital Voices, an international group also known for assisting Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai.\nThe MPs travelled via Dubai where they boarded a connecting flight to a European country. Once we are settled in the west, we will restart our political campaign for freeing Afghanistan, said one of the MPs who pointed to the heightened risk that their families continue to face under the Taliban rule.\nShe said there are a handful of former women MPs who are eager to leave the country. In the last two decades, Afghanistan produced several notable women political activists and MPs especially from the ethnic minorities like the Tajiks and the Hazara communities. But the future of women representation appears bleak as the Taliban is unlikely to welcome their participation.\nEvacuation flights from Afghanistan have stopped but the Afghans who are stationed in neighbouring areas continue to move towards the west creating a rare surge in legal and illegal immigration to Europe and North America. It is understood that several Afghan political figures took refuge in India following the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban on August 15.",

We are again well prepared to meet any misadventure that may occur as we have demonstrated in the past.\" \"Such kinds of incidents will continue to occur till such time that a long-term solution is reached, and that is to have a boundary agreement.

Based on those evaluations, the Indian Army formulates strategies and doctrines that are needed to meet future threats, he noted. \"This is a continuous process that never stops,\"\" he added.\nKabul fell to the Taliban on August 15.

It is a dynamic grid and it is based on threat perception and the escalating levels of attempts by our western neighbour (Pakistan) to push in more and more terrorists,\" he said.\nBased on ups and downs, we also recalibrate our levels of operations, he added.\nThe current border standoff between the Indian and Chinese armieserupted in May last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area. Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.\nThe row escalated after the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 last year.Twenty Indian Army personnel laid down their lives in the clashes that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.\nIn February 2021, China officially acknowledged that five Chinese military officers and soldiers were killed in the clashes with the Indian Army though it is widely believed that the death toll was higher.\nAs a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in Gogra area last month.\nIn February, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in line with an agreement on disengagement.\nEach side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC (Line of Actual Control) in the sensitive sector.\nIn 2017, Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.",

The past couple of months have undoubtedly been the best days of my life. Standing on the podium in Tokyo along with my teammates with whom I have shared some of the most incredible experiences of my life was a feeling I will cherish forever,\" Rupinder wrote in a statement posted on his official twitter handle.\n\"I believe it is time for me to make way for young and talented players to experience every great joy I have felt in these last 13 years of representing India.\" The 30-year-old Rupinder, regarded as one of the best drag-flickers of the country, represented India in 223 matches.\nRupinder was an intergral part of the Indian hockey team that won bronze medal in the Tokyo Games this year, ending a 41-year-old medal drought for the eight-time Olympic champions.",

He had also taken a dig at Sidhu over his resignation, saying he is not a stable man.\nThe meeting took place amid efforts of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to ensure a contest in the forthcoming assembly polls in Punjab.\nThe BJP faces a formidable political challenge in the state from ruling Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and SAD-BSP combine. Shiromani Akali Dal was a trusted partner of BJP in Punjab but parted ways over its stance on the farm laws.\nIf Amarinder Singh joins the BJP, the political equations in the state will change and will give the party an advantage in assembly polls.\nFrom being seen as a non-contender in the power equations, the BJP is looking to emerge as a formidable contestant in Punjab assembly polls.

        "body": "Jair Bolsonaro emerges as a risk factor for Brazil IPO pipeline\nNation-states frequently use the principle of sovereigntythe exclusive authority to determine the rules within national boundariesas a justification for their actions. The COVID-19 pandemic is only the most recent example of the shortcomings of sovereignty. With little regard for the common good, the richest countries made sure to secure more than their fair share of vaccines. The World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the World Bank tried to ensure access to the vaccine for poorer countries by setting up the Vaccine Alliance (GAVI). It was supposed to distribute 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. So far, it has managed to distribute only 240 million.\nThe problem has largely been one of supply, given the huge purchases of the vaccine by richer countries. But there is also the challenge of delivering doses to countries where medical infrastructure is weak. As a result, the Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity reports that, as of September 21, just 3.31 per cent of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated with at least one dose, compared to 61.51 per cent of people in high-income countries.\nLets face it: the rich run the world, and the\nUnited Nations\njust doesnt have the power to change that.\nNor has the UN risen to the challenge of climate change. Here the problem is one of brokering effective compromises. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is the body responsible for convening the Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting every year. In Paris, COP21 did manage to produce a binding treaty on climate change. But the commitments made by all the parties to the agreement were not sufficient to reduce carbon emissions fast enough to prevent a catastrophic increase in global temperatures.\nMoreover, the commitments were voluntary. The U.S. delegation insisted on this because it feared that the U.S. Congress would reject any binding pledges.\nIts no surprise, then, that carbon emissions are expected to rise this year by 5 percent, the second largest increase in history.\nALSO READ:\nUS top general defends call to Chinese at end of Trump presidency\nThe fault here again lies mostly with the richest countriesChina, the United States, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabiathat have been the biggest emitters of carbon. But rich countries have also refused to provide enough money to help poorer countries transition to cleaner energy. In 2009, rich countries promised to mobilize $100 billion by 2020 for this transition. A dozen years later, the fund is still $20 billion short.\nOf course, many countries face another deadly scourge: war. Imagine how many lives would be saved, how much reconstruction could take place, and how waves of refugees could be reduced if the UN were able to conduct a peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan, establish an on-the-ground presence in Syria, and separate warring parties in Tigray province in Ethiopia. Instead, the UN is relegated the task of providing humanitarian assistance. Its program in Syria, with a target of $4.2 billion a year, is the largest in the world.\nBut humanitarian assistance is a never-ending drain in the absence of security on the ground. Most of the peacekeeping budget of the UN goes to the existing 13 missions. The Biden administration has promised to pay down the over $1 billion peacekeeping bill it owes the UN, but the UN is going to need a lot more than that to play an effective role in bringing peace and security to the most conflict-torn areas of the world.\nFor one thing, the UN doesnt have a capability to respond quickly to emergencies around the world. An Emergency Peace Service could fill that gap. It has some support internationally, and its even come up twice as bills in the U.S. Congress. Without a permanent, professional corps of emergency responders, the UN will constantly be one step behind in dealing with crises around the world.\nThis is not an easy time for the United Nations. It is underfunded. Proposals to reform its governance have largely gone nowhere. It has been forced to cobble together ad hoc responses to the worlds biggest problems.\nBut perhaps the biggest challenge to the UN is the refusal of nation-states to delegate sufficient authority to",

File. | Photo Credit: PTI\nHe risks eroding big chunk of Hindu vote bank that has traditionally favoured Congress\nTwo days ago, cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu\nquit as president\nof the Punjab Congress, asserting he would not compromise on the struggle for Punjab-favoured agenda, even as his politics in the recent past is seen to have been largely revolving around Sikh (panthic) issues in an attempt to politically corner the Badals of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), keeping other potent issues at bay.\nIn April, after remaining in political slumber since his resignation from the Punjab Cabinet in 2019, Mr. Sidhu resurrected his political ride by going to a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala,near Bargari village of Faridkot. The village was the epicentre of sacrilege incidents in 2015. Two Sikh protesters were killed at Behbal Kalan during protests against the sacrilege.\nMr. Sidhu had been forcefully raising the issue of providing justice in the sacrilege incidents and hitting out at both his own government and the Badal family in an attempt to project himself and the Congress as pro-panth.\nIn his bid to garner Sikh votes focussing on the communitys issues and by presenting himself as pro-panthic by evoking the Bargari sacrilege issue repeatedly, Mr. Sidhu possibly does not realise that ahead of 2022 Assembly election, the over focus on panthic issues could end up eroding a substantial section of the Hindu vote bank that, according to many political analysts, has traditionally been with the Congress.\nIn Punjab, panthic voters have been traditionally associated with the SAD, while Hindu voters have traditionally been inclined towards the Congress.\nThe Congress has always had its support base among Hindus and Sikhs. But over-focussing on panthic issues could create problems as it would be playing in the domain of the Akali Dal. The Congress should not go overboard with such issues. Already, the Akali Dal is on the back foot over the sacrilege issue. The Congress, in fact, should show some action on the ground rather than making noise. Mr. Sidhus attempt to foray into panthic voters could backfire as the Hindu voters could swing, said Ashutosh Kumar, professor, political science department, Punjab University.\nPunjab-based writer and political analyst Desraj Kali said resignation over the issue surrounding Bargari was not justified.\nMr. Sidhu should have realised that there are several other issues beyond the Bargari sacrilege that have plagued Punjab. People in Punjab are facing issues of unemployment, drugs, economic mess, farmer and labourer problems and their suicides. He quit on only one agenda, he said.",

The company is set to file draft initial public offering documents this month, Reuters reported last week, joining a wave of Indian start-ups looking to go public this year.\nBut Zostel filed a petition in August with the Delhi High Court to stop Oyo from changing its shareholder structure, including through an IPO, the petition, seen by Reuters, said.\n'No definite pact'\nTheir 2015 deal was for Oyo to buy some of Zostel's businesses, while Zostel would get a 7% stake in Oyo. The transaction fell apart but the companies have been in along-running legal battle over the terms, with Oyo arguing that they had not reached a definitive agreement.\nIn 2018, India's Supreme Court appointed an arbitrator on the case, who in March this year ruled that the terms of the deal were binding and Zostel was entitled to claim the 7% stake in Oyo.\nZostel \"did everything within their control to complet etheir obligations\" while Oyo breached its obligations by failing to execute a definitive agreement, the arbitrator said.\nOyo has challenged the arbitration order in the Delhi High Court.\nA legal counsel for Oyo said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday: \"till the time that parties do not come to anagreement on the terms of the definitive agreements and the same are not executed, no right whatsoever arises in favour of any party for any type of shares to be issued in Oyo.\"\nZostel is opposing any attempt by Oyo to alter its shareholding structure, Paavan Nanda, Zostel co-founder, said in a response to Reuters.\nOyo's lawyers in the court on Wednesday objected to requests from Zostel's counsel to keep the contested 7% stake in escrow.The judge declined this request and set an Oct. 7 date for adetailed hearing of the case.\nSince its launch in 2013 by CEO Ritesh Agarwal, Oyo hasgrown rapidly, competing with U.S. home rental company Airbnb and home grown chains such as Fab Hotels and Treebo.\nIt runs operations in 35 countries, including India, Europeand Indonesia, and counts Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Ventur ePartners among its other investors.",

So, we believe that US approval will be via a BLA [Biologics License Applications] which we expect to be submitted later this year.\"\nThe FDA has so far authorized three vaccines for emergency used across the United States,\nIn February 2021, the World Health Organization listed two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving the green light for these vaccines to be rolled out globally through the COVAX mechanism.\nAccording to AstraZeneca, its vaccine shows 92 per cent and 86 per cent efficiency against hospitalization in the Delta and Alpha variant cases, respectively. At the same time, a UK-based study from May, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 21, showed that\nAstraZeneca\nwas 33% effective after one dose, 60% effective after two.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nDear Reader,\nBusiness Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.
